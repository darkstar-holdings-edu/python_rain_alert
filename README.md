# Python Rain Alert

This is repo contains code that I generate while working on the [100 Days of Code](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) udemy course for learning Python.

This repo covers the project for day 35 of the course. This project is a "rain alert" that checks the current weather data and sends a SMS message if it is expected to rain that day.
